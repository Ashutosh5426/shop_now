In addition to these endpoints, you will also need to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API and ensure that only authorized users can access certain endpoints or perform certain actions.

You may also need to implement pagination, sorting, and filtering options to allow clients to retrieve data in a more efficient and user-friendly manner.

Finally, you will need to set up a database and connect it to the API to store and retrieve data. You can use MongoDB to store the data and Mongoose to interact with the database from within the API code.
